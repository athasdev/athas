# Project Tabs

Athas supports working with multiple projects simultaneously through project tabs in the title bar.

## Opening Projects

- Click the **+** button in the title bar to open a new project folder
- Each opened project appears as a tab in the title bar

## Switching Between Projects

- Click on any project tab to switch to that project
- Each project maintains its own set of open files and editor state

## Closing Projects

- Hover over a project tab to reveal the close button (X)
- Click the X to close that project
- The last project tab cannot be closed - at least one project must remain open

## Reordering Projects

- Click and drag any project tab to reorder it
- Drop it in the desired position among other tabs

## Right-Click Menu

Right-click on any project tab to access:

- **Close Other Projects** - Closes all project tabs except the one you right-clicked
- **Copy Path** - Copies the project's full file path to clipboard

## Persistence

All project tabs are automatically saved and restored when you restart Athas.
