# Workspaces

In Athas, a workspace is the set of projects you have open in a single window. Each project appears as a tab in the title bar and keeps its own open files and editor state.

## Create a workspace

You can start a workspace in a few ways:

- Open Athas with no project and click the **+** button in the title bar to add your first project.
- Drag and drop a folder onto the editor window to open it as the first project in the workspace.

## Switch workspaces

Athas treats each window as a separate workspace. To switch between workspaces:

- Use your OS app switcher to move between open Athas windows.
- Open a new window and add projects there if you want a separate workspace.

## Manage workspace projects

Inside a workspace, you can add, reorder, and close projects using the project tabs:

- Add a project with the **+** button or by dragging a folder into the window.
- Switch projects by clicking their tabs.
- Reorder tabs by dragging them.
- Close a project using the tab's close button (X).
- Use the tab right-click menu for actions like **Close Other Projects**, **Close to Right**, or **Close All Projects**.

Project tabs are restored when you restart Athas. For more details, see [Project Tabs](/docs/project-tabs).
