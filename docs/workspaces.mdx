A workspace is the set of projects you have open in a single Athas window.

## Create a Workspace

- Drag and drop a folder onto the editor window

## Manage Workspace Projects

- Add a project with the **+** button or by dragging a folder
- Switch projects by clicking their tabs
- Reorder tabs by dragging them
- Close a project using the tab’s close button (X)

Project tabs are restored when you restart Athas. See [Project Tabs](/docs/project-tabs) for more details.
