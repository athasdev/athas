AI Agents are powerful coding assistants that can read and write files, run commands, and help you build software.

## Supported Agents

Athas supports several AI coding agents:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic's coding agent |
| **Gemini CLI** | Google's coding agent |
| **Codex CLI** | OpenAI's coding agent |
| **OpenCode** | SST's open-source agent |
| **Kimi CLI** | Moonshot's coding agent |
| **Qwen Code** | Alibaba's coding agent |

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install your preferred agent:

    | Agent | Install command |
    |-------|-----------------|
    | Claude Code | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
    | Gemini CLI | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli` |
    | Codex CLI | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
    | OpenCode | `go install github.com/sst/opencode@latest` |
    | Kimi CLI | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/kimi-cli` |
    | Qwen Code | `pip install qwen-code` |
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open the AI panel and select the agent from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start chatting - the agent will automatically start when you send a message
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Agents are detected automatically. If an agent appears grayed out, it means it's not installed on your system.
</Callout>

## What Agents Can Do

Unlike regular AI chat, agents can:

- **Read and write files** in your project
- **Run terminal commands** to build, test, or install packages
- **Search your codebase** to understand context
- **Make multi-file changes** in a single conversation

## Permissions

When an agent wants to perform an action (like editing a file or running a command), you'll see a permission prompt:

- Click **Allow** to approve the action
- Click **Deny** to reject it

This keeps you in control of what changes are made to your project.

## Slash Commands

Some agents support slash commands for quick actions. Type `/` in the chat input to see available commands like:

- `/web` - Search the web
- `/compact` - Get concise responses
- `/init` - Initialize a project

Available commands depend on which agent you're using.

## Switching Modes

Some agents (like Claude Code) support different modes:

- **Code Mode** - Full access to read, write, and execute
- **Plan Mode** - Planning only, no file changes
- **Ask Mode** - Questions only, requires approval for actions

Switch modes using the mode selector in the chat header when available.
