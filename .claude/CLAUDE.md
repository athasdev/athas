## Important

- Make sure to read the scripts section in `package.json` before running any of the `npm`
  or `bun` commands
- Run `bun run check:all` from `package.json` before stopping (if you touched typescript
  files) to make sure typescript compiles and linting passes
- Run `cargo check` before stopping (if you touched rust files) to make sure rust compiles
